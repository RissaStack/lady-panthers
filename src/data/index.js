Basketball is a very lovable sport especially for Jizell because she can go out on the court and just forget about all any problems and just shoot away. It’s also something she loves doing! Jizell can’t wait for a great season with the the Coconino Girls Basketball team!! Go Panthers!",

        description: "Autumn Larsen is a 16-year-old Junior this year. She is homeschooled so you won't see her in the hallways at school and she is probably the last person you should ask for directions. When Autumn is not in basketball season she loves to play volleyball and softball. When she is not playing sports she loves to ride her horse, be outside working, hiking, going to the creek and lake. She also loves being in the kitchen baking and cooking. Her favorite thing to make is chocolate chip cookies. Outside of sports, Autumn makes cinnamon rolls and cookies for Momma Kneads Dough. She also trains horses and gives horse riding lessons. She has a big family! In total, there are 9 people in the family including her 6 siblings. Autumn loves to be with her family. They are usually out on adventures or going to practice or in some kind of competition amongst all the siblings. Most of the time you will find Autumn with a little shadow because of all her younger siblings. She plans to have a big family of her own one day. When Autumn graduates high school she wants to get a degree in business management to own her own business one day. She also plans to go on a mission for the Church of Jesus Chist of Latter Day Saints. On the basketball court,  Autumn will probably be the first name you remember because she is usually the loudest on and off the court. She is not afraid to let her voice echo in the gym. Autumn is also really funny because she speaks exactly what comes to her mind and sometimes doesn't understand the currrent slang. Autumn loves basketball because it is mentally and physically difficult. She has learned to push herself to a whole new level. It has really helped her learn that your body can go past the limits of her mind. Autumn also loves the community and friends basketball brings.  She says they have all seen each other at at their lowest and highest points. She has more close friends from basketball than from any other sport. Autumn says that Coconino basketball has the best coaches. They may yell or make them run but the coaches always know what is best for them.  They are always invested in the players. It doesn't matter if they have been there for 4 years or a week. When you walk in the gym there are always smiling coaches waiting to meet you and talk or laugh with you. She has learned the best life lessons and got the best advice from the coaches. Coconino girls basketball is a family from the freshman to the seniors. Autumn loves that everyone cheers eachother on and nobody believes they are better than anyone else. They are all there to learn and get better at basketball. They are all going to have a little fun while getting better, while laughing and joking and having a good time. They all push to their limits and help eachother get better.",
